roadmap:
UI improvements (color scheme, etc)
Accept a word in one language (e.g. native language of a user, configured) and add a word in target language (can be added as a separate mode or page) for cases when user want to learn how to say X in target language.
Auto delete a word after good streak
Stop tiktok media playing (other apps are mostly supported)
allow customization of gpt model (or even better - provider customization (via langchain for example))
Update AI prompt to take into account language pairs, avoid hardcoding eng-rus
add practice mode (fully like anki, to practice without opening apps. Maybe also add "random words" mode there)
add kebab menu to overlay screen to delete/edit word right from there
Add properties for analytics of progress + add analytics (charts, etc)
Use AI to view already added words, estimate approximate user's level and suggest words which they might not know (and easily add them to vocabulary list)
fix a bug with random "No word loaded" screen which later disappears on any click on the screen
When user exports vocabulary, ask if they want to keep progress (to later import it on another device and continue) or reset it (to share with others)
Add import of own json format

long roadmap:
add user accounts and cloud backup
add imports and improve existing (support more formats, improve anki support, etc)
add decks
add tests
add "add word" option to selection popup (when word is selected in some other app)
add integration with gemini assistant (to add words via voice)
Support rich formatting
